# Employee-Retention-Prediction-using-Decision-Tree-Classifier
This project leverages a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether an employee will leave the organization (LeaveOrNot) based on various employee attributes. Using the Employee.csv dataset, categorical features are preprocessed using Label Encoding, and the model is trained and evaluated using a train-test split methodology.
